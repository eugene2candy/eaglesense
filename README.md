## OVERVIEW

New project coming soon.

*EagleSense* is a top-view tracking system that leverages a depth-infrared hybrid sensing pipeline for real-time human activity and device recognition. It provides a minimalistic RESTful API that can be used by ubicomp applications (e.g., proxemic-aware or cross-device systems) in interactive spaces.

2. Follow this [installation guide](http://www.picnet.com.au/blogs/guido/post/2016/09/22/xgboost-windows-x64-binaries-for-download/) (Download the XGBoost dll and install the Python package).

*Tested on Windows 10 with Python 3.6 x64. The Anaconda distribution will contain most of the Python requirements.*

See also the official XGBoost [installation guide](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html).

### Keras, Theano, and TensorFlow

## BUILD

1. Initialize project directories

	```bash
	cd eaglesense/
	python setup.py
	```

### Tracking System

1. Set the following system environment variables.
    * **PYTHON3** : `/path/to/python3` (or `path/to/anaconda`)
    * **BOOSTCPP** : `/path/to/boost`
    * **OPENCV3** : `/path/to/opencv3`


2. Add `/path/to/opencv/build/x64/vc14/bin` to `PATH`.

3. Open `/path/to/eaglesense/eaglesense/topviewkinect/topviewkinect.sln`.

4. Set solution configuration to `Release x64`.

5. In the solution explorer, right click the `topviewkinect` project then select `Properties`. Include the following fields as needed.
    * VC++ Directories --> Include Directories
		> `$(KINECTSDK20_DIR)\inc;$(VC_IncludePath);$(WindowsSDK_IncludePath);`

    * VC++ Directories --> Library Directories
		> `$(KINECTSDK20_DIR)\lib\x64;$(VC_LibraryPath_x64);$(WindowsSDK_LibraryPath_x64);$(NETFXKitsDir)Lib\um\x64`

    * C/C++ --> General --> Additional Include Directories
		> `include;$(OPENCV3)\build\include;$(BOOSTCPP);$(PYTHON3)\include;$(PYTHON3)\Lib\site-packages\numpy\core\include`

    * Linker --> General --> Additional Library Directories
		> `$(OPENCV3)\build\x64\vc14\lib;$(BOOSTCPP)\lib64-msvc-14.0;$(PYTHON3)\libs;$(PYTHON3)\Lib\site-packages\numpy\core\lib;%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)`

    * Linker --> Input --> Additional Dependencies
		> `opencv_world310.lib;kinect20.lib;python[VERSION].lib;_tkinter.lib;npymath.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)`

		*where [VERSION] is the Python version without the dot, e.g. for Python 3.6 [VERSION] would be **36***

6. Click `Build` then `Build solution` (CTRL + SHIFT + B).
